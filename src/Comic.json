I want it looking good and pretty, that’s for sure. Still, if you’re itching to send a few bucks my way for whatever reason, my donation button still works just fine, and I always appreciate any money thrown in my face direction!\nOne last thing! If you’ve been following this comic on Tapastic – Well, just “Tapas” now – then you’ve probably noticed that my comic is GONE! This is because of a really terrible new policy that the Tapas team has put in their website, and if you’re a fellow comic creator, I highly recommend getting the hell off that site before they completely screw you over.\nAnyways! That’s all for now, folks! See you again next Thursday!"
